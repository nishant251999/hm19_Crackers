Plan of Action:

-The prototype is all software based for now.
-It takes any camera feed in input and returns the speed and type of vehicle(with help of ML).
-Speed limits are then set and an image of vehicles breaching that limit is captured.
-Multiple images are captured to ensure the best possible view of the vehicle’s number plate.
-Through OCR, the number plate can be read.
-Date, time and location can easily be found with the help of image saved in computer and location of the auto rickshaw (use of GPS).
-The time, location and vehicle’s number are then mailed to concerned authorities with the help of a python script.
